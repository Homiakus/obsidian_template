# API Toolbar

Always visible bottom toolbar for Obsidian with configurable buttons.
Each button sends an HTTP request to an external service with information
about the currently open note. The request method, endpoint and payload
are configured in the plugin settings. Buttons support lucide icons, GET or
POST requests and retry/timeout options.
